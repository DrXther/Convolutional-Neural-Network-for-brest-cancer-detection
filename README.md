# Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-brest-cancer-detection
Medical image processing project for my university course. 

In this project I train a CNN model on small amount of data for medical image processing.  
This model was trained on about ~2.2k sample images of cancerous and non-cancerous brest scans that achived 0.81 test acuraccy.

Split of data was:  
 - 80% training data
 - 10% validation data
 - 10% test data

To my knowlage this is not the recomended proportion nor the amount, the scope of this project was small enough that it was not a problem for my, but a 70/15/15 data split and raised amount of data (~3-4k) would probably have better results.
